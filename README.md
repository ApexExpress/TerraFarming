Mars Preserve Foundation Growing Everyday 2024 <reesrved>

## Concept Vision Idea
The primary idea behind Terra Farming is to reintroduce essential gases like oxygen and nitrogen into the Martian atmosphere while simultaneously cultivating vegetation in underground silos. Each silo would house a network of new plant growth, contributing to the production and expansion of these vital gases.
### Take Aways
+ Ensure Daily Growth is maintained 
+ Collaborate with others to ensure growth is kept moving

## Farming Operations
Farming operations will be conducted [ ... ]
The construction of the framework for these new underground silos would require detailed planning and execution in scope and time. This could involve selecting suitable locations, designing the silos to withstand the Martian environment, and choosing plant species that can thrive in these conditions.
Further more planning would need to be approved through permit system.
### Fencing Security Plans
Plants & Fences
Create a fence:
+ dig post holes
+ move fence poles
+ place fence poles
## Holdings
The holdings section could refer to the resources or assets required for this project. This might include the physical materials for constructing the silos, the seeds or plants for cultivation, and the technology for monitoring and maintaining the environment within the silos.
### Digital Assets
create new digital assets from old DATA.
+ (A.) Follow the new links will update with titles.
+ (B.) symlink new links for network.
+ (C.) digital assets creation from DATA.
## Security
Security in this context could refer to ensuring the safety and integrity of the digital holdings related to the construction plans. This might involve implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect against unauthorized access or data breaches.
## Conculsion
This is a fascinating concept that combines space exploration with environmental science and agriculture. Itâ€™s a testament to the innovative solutions that can be developed when we think outside the box and consider the possibilities beyond our own planet. With that being stated the future will be bright.
